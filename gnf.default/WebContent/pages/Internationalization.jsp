    <h4 class="mt-5">Internationalization</h4>
    <p class="mt-5">Internationalization, in relation to computer
      programming, is the process of designing and writing an
      application so that it can be used in a global or multinational
      context. An internationalized program is capable of supporting
      different languages, as well as date, time, currency, and other
      values, without software modification. This usually involves "soft
      coding" or separating textual components from program code and may
      involve pluggable code modules.</p>
    <p class="mt-5">Internationalization is often shortened to I18N
      by practitioners. The rationale is that there are 18 letters
      between the beginning I and final N in internationalization. Try
      saying and writing "internationalization" more than a few times
      and you will appreciate the value of the shorter version.
      Additionally, you may see "I18N'ed" as a shortened form of
      "internationalized." While grammatically imprecise and technically
      incorrect, "I18N'ed" is useful and you will see it frequently in
      the literature, including this tutorial.</p>
