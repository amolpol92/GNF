# GNF
This project is evolved from dlpps which was single module project. 
The project has many modules which is indepently scalable. Each module is deployed on appengine as services &amp; communicate through JSON. 
<br><br>The gnf.ui contains all UI files & rest of the modules act as backend services. <br><br>The gnf.default can be further decomposed 
into multiple services, that is one of the action item which has to be done.
